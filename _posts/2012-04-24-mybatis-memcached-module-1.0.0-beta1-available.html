title: MyBatis-memcached module 1.0.0-beta1 available
---

<br />we have finally made available a first beta of MyBatis-Memcached<br />integration module, you can find more details on the related <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/caches/memcached/" target="_blank">site</a><br /><br />Please take in consideration that the beta status is because we<br />recently migrated an old code to the MyBatis SVN, and we are not sure<br />we missed something before announcing a proper release.<br /><br />As always, feedbacks/suggestions/proposals/... are always welcome, so<br />don't be shy and help us making MyBatis a better ecosystem :)<br /><br />-Simo, on behalf of the MyBatis team
