title: Schema Migrations 3.1.0 Released!
---

I've just released MyBatis Schema Migrations 3.1.0. &nbsp;It contains mostly bug fixes, but is also the first release since splitting it out into its own sub-project. It also contains a number of improved defaults in the environment properties files.<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/wiki/Migration">http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/wiki/Migration</a><br /><br />I plan to do an updated tutorial video with narration to help new users.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Note: The Maven release and thus the Maven plugin have not been updated yet.</i></span><br /><br /><br />
