title: Happy Birthday to MyBatis - 10 years
---

10 years ago today, the very first version of MyBatis was released to the public. &nbsp;Then called "The iBATIS Database Layer", the library wasn't actually released as a separate product on this day. &nbsp;Rather it was included in JPetStore as the curious persistence library that caught the eye of many Java developers that read the original whitepaper. <br /><br />It was originally posted on TSS:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread.tss?thread_id=14243">http://www.theserverside.com/discussions/thread.tss?thread_id=14243</a><br /><br />The white paper that started it all is here: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.clintonbegin.com/downloads/JPetStore-1-2-0.pdf">http://www.clintonbegin.com/downloads/JPetStore-1-2-0.pdf</a><br /><br />After seeing the reaction from the community I released the persistence framework separately on a private server, and eventually on SourceForge about 6 months later. You can still go and grab version 1.1 if you like: <br /><br /><a href="http://ibatisdb.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ibatisdb/ibatisdb/">http://ibatisdb.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ibatisdb/ibatisdb/</a><br /><br />Not long after that, I was at a conference in New York where I met Ted Husted. &nbsp;He educated me on the merits of the Apache Software Foundation and invited me to submit iBATIS to the Apache Incubator project, and ultimately we became a TLC. &nbsp;We spent about 6 years as an Apache project.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">All good things come to an end though. We evolved in a different direction than the Apache Software Foundation, and thus the team voted to leave the ASF. &nbsp;iBATIS is now in the attic at Apache, as you can see by the large red banner at the top of the now retired Apache iBATIS homepage.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/">http://ibatis.apache.org/</a><br /><br />Open source is not without its lawyers, and thus we had to leave the name iBATIS behind with the ASF -- even though we brought it in. Funny how that works. <br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">But no matter, MyBatis was born! It is a more appropriate name anyway, leaving the roots in cryptography behind it. As it turned out - thanks to a number of our creative team members - we ended up with a&nbsp;</span><b style="background-color: white;">way</b><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;cooler logo too! &nbsp;In addition we grew our team and created a number of sub-projects, all happily hosted at Google Code. &nbsp;</span><br /><br />What does the future hold? &nbsp;MyBatis 3 is by far the best version ever. &nbsp;It is the most active, stable and feature rich of any previous release. &nbsp;This is all thanks to our hard working team. &nbsp;So why mess with something like that? <br /><br />Well, my guess is that some of the cool features of Java 8 will open new doors for MyBatis. &nbsp;The new API possibilities will likely be too tempting to ignore, and thus I would imagine MyBatis 4 will begin sometime after Java 8 arrives. &nbsp;Whatever the future holds, I hope it's a lot of fun and continues to offer a great deal of value to our users.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Clinton<br /><br />
